InstaGallery is an easy way to access your Instagram account and get your gallery and get his media in a few steps.

## How to use
1. You need a Facebook Developer account, go to [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a new account if you haven't yet
2. Create a new Facebook application following the steps that appear on the official web site [Create Facebook Application for Instagram](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started)
3. Open your `Info.plist`
4. Set a new key with name `InstagramClientId` and set your Instagram App Id in this key
5. Set a new key with name `InstagramRedirectURI` and set with your Instagram App Redirect URI

InstaGallery is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

## Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler. 

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/MRodSebastian/InstaGallery.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.4.0"))
]
```
